# Data-Science-Project-proj632
This is our project of data science (web scraping) as student in Polytech Annecy Chamb√©ry.

The goal is to collect all french health facilities in order to improve their efficiency on the territory.

# Results
This code creates two CSV files with the list of the french health facilities and the population by frech department.
Do not forget to fill the 'fichier_a_completer' and adapt the patsh and the api rights to your own machine.
Then you can read the CVS files with Excel for example.
